# India Air Pollution
## Goal of this Data Analysis :

1. Understanding content how India is polluted by state wise.

2. Finding the top 10 polluted places in India.

3. Seeing how bad India suffering from air pollution.

4. What are the sources of India's air pollution.

5. Which cities of India will be improved AQI.


## Analysis Includes :

1. Exploratory Data Analysis, handling missing values & data manipulation.

2. Data Visualisation & Network Analysis through Power Bi

3. Insights


## Observation : 
This dataset contains of 13 features they are stn_code, sampling_date, state, location, agency, type, so2, no2, rspm, spm, location_monitoring_station, pm2_5, date and it has 5 - float64, 8 - object datatype. Seeing how bad India is suffering from air pollution. 
The pollutant given in this dataset is a)RSPM - Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter :- particulate matter with diameter of less than or equal to 10 micrometres. They are produced from combustion process, vehicles and industrial sources; b)SO2 :- Sulphur Dioxed; c)NO2 :- Nitrogen Dioxed; 
d)PM2.5 :-  Particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than  2.5μm; e)SPM - Suspended Particulate Matter :- such as dust, fumes, mist, and smoke. The concentration of these in and near the urban areas causes severe pollution to the surroundings. 
 

## Conclusion :
As we can see that at West Bengal, Delhi, Haryana & Rajasthan high AQI values and at the industrial area the air pollution is high compared to other types (considering all the types). While comparing between SO2 & NO2, NO2 is high in both industrial area and RIRUO. 

### Key influencers : 
1. NO2 :– In state  “West Bengal, Delhi, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Rajasthan” , In types the industrial area and the top segment is West Bengal having average value of 58.68 it’s more the overall average 24.85. 
2. SO2 :– In state “Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Gujarat” , In types the industrial area and the top segment is Maharashtra having average value of 16.77 it’s more the overall average 9.97
